    <h1><a href="https://github.com/hazelnitwit/Nitty">Nitty</a> - simple discord.js bot</h1>
    
    <p>Nitty, the discord utility bot<br>  
    Made for the hazelnitwit and his collaborators<br>
    This bot and it's code are NOT guaranteed for use outside of hazelnitwit's umbrella. Be warned.<br><br>
    The bot utilizes <a href="https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js">discord.js</a> version 14.7.1 and the project is linted using <a href="https://github.com/eslint/eslint">ESLint</a> version 8.32.0 <br>
    (Please note that a default `.eslintrc.json` file is NOT included, and be warned that my code is nowhere near easily readable)<br>
    Packages are compiled using `npm pack` and can be initialized using `npm init`<br><br>
    This is my first project involving JS in many years, so I am rusty, and there will likely be many revisions and commits.</p>
