# Nitty - simple discord.js utility bot

> Made for hazelnitwit and his collaborators, built to act as an example bot

More info: https://nitty.vercel.app

## How do I use it?

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2.  Run one of the following commands to start the bot:

```bash
npm run ts-dev
// or
npm run ts-start
```

The difference between the two is that `npm run ts-dev` will restart the bot when you make changes to the code, while `npm run ts-start` will not.
